# 📚 BookQuery

BookQuery is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorites to a personalized reading list. Originally built with a RESTful API, this version has been fully refactored to utilize GraphQL with Apollo Server on the backend and Apollo Client on the frontend.
